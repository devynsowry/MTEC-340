# My Favorite Game

My favorite game is **Minecraft**.

Minecraft is my favorite game because of the **unlimited possibilities**. You can play survival by yourself, or with friends, make your own creations in creative mode, or play online on servers with many different game types.

Minecraft was officially released by [**Mojang**](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) in 2011 (although now it is owned by Microsoft) and specifically developed by Markus Persson, commonly referred to as "**Notch**", in Sweden.

**Java** is the game engine used for the original PC version. This is actually what got me into programming when I was younger by developing plug-ins for servers... embarrassing, I know.
